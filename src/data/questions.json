    "solution": "No, the Greedy approach does **not** work for 0/1 Knapsack. \nChoosing the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio can lead to empty space in the knapsack that could have been filled by a combination of other items yielding a higher total value. \n\nDynamic Programming is required."
